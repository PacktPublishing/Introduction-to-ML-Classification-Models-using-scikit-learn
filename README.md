# Introduction to ML Classification Models using scikit-learn [Video]
This is the code repository for Introduction to ML Classification Models using scikit-learn [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/introduction-ml-classification-models-using-scikit-learn-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
This course will give you a fundamental understanding of machine learning with a focus on building classification models. The basic concepts of machine learning (ML) are explained, including supervised and unsupervised learning; regression and classification; and overfitting. There are three lab sections which focus on building classification models using support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests using real data sets. The implementation will be performed using the scikit-learn library for Python.
